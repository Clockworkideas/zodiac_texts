With rented equipment and black-and-white negative film left over from the movie "Lenny," he and Bill Paxton took off for Morocco where they intended to shoot a picture based loosely on the J. Paul Getty kidnapping. After being harassed by government authorities, they "Taking Tiger Mountain" premieres at the UC Theater in Berkeley on Thursday and plays at the Roxie, 311716th Street, San Francisco, beginning Friday. In his youth Huckabee said he had been strongly influenced by the book "The SCUM Manifesto" by Valerie Solonas, one of Andy Warhol's superstars who later turned on him and tried to kill him. The "SCUM" in the book's title stands for "The Society For Cutting Up Men." While this was the original inspiration for the band of feminist terrorists in 'Taking Tiger Mountain," jHuckabee said he didn't want "the women to be the bad guys either." Within the context of the film they are believable people, not raging Amazons. The fact that "Taking Tiger Mountain" was completed at all is a minor mir-'acle in itself. The fact that the film works so well is a credit to the alchemical wizardry of Huckabee.
