 If the South Dakota Democratic party were to name its top program planner, Art Jones, state senator from Marshall and Day. would be a prominent contender. For the past four conventions he has been chairman of the platform committee and in the past three legislatures he has been the Senate Democratic leader. NAME MENTIONED For the past four years his name has been mentioned as i potential candidate for higher of fice. But what do the cards hold in the future for the Marshall Coun ty farmer? Will he continue in the state Senate or will he try to take a step up the political ladder? If he does have any plans he's keeping them to himself. He simp ly says no comment when asked if he is thinking about entering a statewide contest. WOULD MAKE PLANS But there are plenty of Democrats who would like to make plans for him. With the Demo cratic primary eight months away, Jones name is being ad vanced for governor, cqngress- man and lieutenant governor. His friends compare him to Kenneth Holum who came within 4,000 votes of unseating Sen. Francis Case in 19d6. Botn are farmers and both have been prominent in REA affairs and farm organizations. Jones is cur rently president of the East River Electric Co-op. But whether Jones runs or not, some observers feel, depends on what former Gov. Ralph Herseth does. They are close friends and Jones worked hard pushing Her- seth's program in the 1959 legis lature. Friends don't expect the two to tangle in a primary battle.
