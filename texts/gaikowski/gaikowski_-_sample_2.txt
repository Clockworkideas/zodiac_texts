In 1979 Huckabee was looking for a major project to undertake. He had seen the rough cut of Smith's proposed film. "I thought there was some good stuff in it, and felt it was a shame that it didn't come out," he said. "I decided to take it and see what I could do with it but soon realized the original idea wouldn't work." Huckabee raised more than $40,000 additional money, abandoned the original plot, rewrote and reedited the film, wrote new dialogue, shot some additional scenes and in the process has created an entirely new film. Smith's footage is moody, stark and filled with a $$BL t '1liSilBBl Bill Paxton as an American brainwashed and programmed to assassinate a British major in 'Taking Tiger Mountain' feeling of doom and decay. How he got the Welsh townspeople to participate so willingly in what must have seemed an outlandish idea, including some x-rated scenes, could be a story in itself. In Los Angeles, Huckabee hired professional British actors who were experienced in dubbing dialogue. He also shot 20 additional minutes of film, the section with the feminist terrorists. In all it took him three years to complete a film which had been originally started eight years ago. Billy Hampton, an American draft evader (played by Bill Paxton), is brainwashed and programmed to be an assassin by a feminist terrorist organization. He is sent to a Welsh village, designated a recreational prostitution area by the Common Market. There the young American is to assassinate the man in charge of the village who sells "girls and boys in their peak years of allurement" Major Guthrie Whitbread, a retired British Army officer, is that target. He always tells young men about the time he served in India and his military unit captured Tiger Mountain. The film was originally begun in 1975 by Kent Smith, a documentary filmmaker from Los Angeles.
