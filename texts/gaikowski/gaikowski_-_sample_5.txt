While most of the political pundits in South Dakota say it's a foregone conclusion that George McGov-em, Food - for - Peace administrator, will be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1962, it ap pears that to the former Demo- fcratic' congressman the future is less clear. On his visit to the state last week, he did more than SDeak to church and " p. civic e r o u ds. ' - -j 1 ra c it o v e r n a placed his ear to jA tlie politicalf V ground and vis- -ited with nart f ' v leaders from McGovern the precinct level on up. It would seem that whether he runs or not is dependent upon three conditions. These conditions are: The internal condition of the state's Democratic party. Unless Democrats are united it will be useless for the Democrats to do more than put up a token fight in 1962. It is no secret that the Kennedy administration official thinks that a new chairman and executive secretary are needed to unite Democrats. McGovern 's health. Although McGovern has been making a remarkable recovery from h i s attack of hepatitis, which he suffered last spring, the effects of the illness are still felt. How his health holds up under his strenuous schedule the next three months will be a factor. A private poll will be conducted by Democrats within the next three months, to see who would make the strongest candi- dates for the Senate race, the congressional races, and the gov ernor's race. If the poll shows that McGovern is not the strong est candidate the Democrats have For the Senate, it appears he will bow out in favor of someone else. Democrats can expect that Mc Govern will not run unless all three of the conditions are favor able.
